fractal-fun
===========
Playing around with javascript, web workers, canvas, etc...


I'm using a coordinate system to create the simplest fractal i know, 
turning each line per fractal level of detail into 6 lines, coordinates changing with orientation.

Currently working on a zoom function and getting my progress bars to increase smoothly.
